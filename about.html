<p>
Hello, we are six classic Lolita enthusiasts â€“ Rabbit Reverie, kayas.coords, Applesaladtea, Petit Piaf, Framboise, and Hennrie. We came together with a love for this fashion with its attention to details and understated elegance. We decided to form a brand around these two concepts after we encountered frustration in not being able to find items on the market that fit this aesthetic. We dreamed up the concept of Reverie Romantique as a way to channel our combined visions and skills into creating pieces evocative of the classic charm that brought us into Lolita. </p>

<h1>About Reverie Romantique</h1>
<p>
Reverie Romantique is a vision of vintage bygone times and antique dreams. Our aim is to provide a variety of creations that range from accessories with understated charm to statement pieces with opulent decadence. Each piece is carefully thought out and lovingly created by our talented individual members and designed to work with the other pieces. We hope you can join us on this journey and add a bit of classic charm to your life with Reverie Romantique.</p>
