<div class="product-description">
The lace armwarmers are made of stretch lace, delicate tulle lace, and cotton loop lace imported from Japan. All laces are tea-dyed in small batches and the lace is carefully hand-gathered. Each armwarmer has a lace-up back and is adorned on the front with a handmade bow. All ribbons are imported high quality cotton satin ribbons by the Japanese manufacturer Rose Rosa.

Additional notes: the finished product will feature a different stretch lace. Please refer to the Double Ruffle Lace Cuffs to see the stretch lace that will be used. The ribbon design of the finished product will also be slightly different (but will be made of the same ribbon, with approximately the same overall size). The stretch lace and lace-up back allow these armwarmers to accommodate most people.
